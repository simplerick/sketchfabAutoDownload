# How to use
* Enable multiple download without asking in your primary browser (I used Safari)
* Open `canvas_loading.ipynb`, in cell 2 enter your collection id. Then notebooks will create `index_tst.html` and alter `init_model.js` with necessary space for canvases and corresponding `uid`s of models
* Open `intex_tst.html` in your browser
* Wait for model screens download spamming machine stops downloaling
* Enjoy: screens are in downloads folder (of your browser), the names are `model_UID_tst-k.png`
